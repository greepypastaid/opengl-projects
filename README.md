# GreepypastaID's Mini OpenGL-Projects

**Welcome to OpenGL Projects in Bahasa!**
A small collection of beginner-friendly OpenGL exercises focused on basic shapes, coloring, and simple graphics techniques. Projects use GLFW + GLAD and are intended for learning core concepts (shaders, vertex attributes, VBO/VAO, blending).

## Projects
- Triangles — practice drawing triangles and per-vertex color interpolation (gradients).
- Squares — learn indexed drawing (EBO) and basic transforms.
- Simple House — compose basic primitives into a scene and apply coloring.
- Coloring Techniques — experiments with vertex/fragment shaders for color.
- MIT Logo — exercise combining shapes to form a logo.
- Hewlett Packard Logo - Excersice combining shape from a logo.
- Wolf Logo - Advanced combining shape exercise
- Texture - Learning how to make or use texture

## Key features
- Per-vertex colors producing smooth color gradients.
- Shader-based rendering (GLSL vertex + fragment shaders).
- Basic alpha blending controlled from the application.
- Minimal, portable C/C++ code suitable for learning and extension.

## Run / Controls (typical)
- Just Launch the compiled executable WKWKKW!!!
